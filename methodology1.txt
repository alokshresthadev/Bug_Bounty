i chose a wildcard then use subfinder then used httpx to find 404 and 200 
then used subzy on 404 
then used waybackurls on 200 then checked for open redirect
then use katana 
then used secretfinder no what to do

Nice work so far, Alok. You‚Äôve built a solid initial recon workflow! Here's a breakdown of what you've done and what you can do next to pivot from recon to vulnerability discovery and exploitation.
‚úÖ Your Recon Workflow So Far (Nice!)

    Wildcard target ‚Äî Great start for wide surface coverage.

    subfinder ‚Äî Enumerates subdomains.

    httpx ‚Äî Checks for live hosts and status codes (200/404).

    subzy on 404s ‚Äî Looks for subdomain takeovers.

    waybackurls on 200s ‚Äî Gets archived endpoints for further analysis.

    Checked open redirect ‚Äî Good early vuln to check.

    katana ‚Äî Spidering and crawling for hidden endpoints.

    SecretFinder ‚Äî Looks for secrets like API keys in JS files.

Now that you've done recon + light scanning, it‚Äôs time to move deeper into vulnerability enumeration and testing.
üîç What to Do Next ‚Äî Move Toward Bug Discovery
1. JS File Analysis (Deep Dive)

Use the JS files you found via katana or waybackurls:

    Use LinkFinder or JSParser to extract endpoints.

    Look for API endpoints or interesting parameters like:

        ?id=, ?url=, ?file=, ?path=, ?redirect=

    Check if any contain hardcoded secrets or tokens.

    Look for client-side validation only (use Burp to test bypasses).

2. Vulnerability Scanning

Now you should actively look for OWASP Top 10 vulns.
‚úÖ Use Nuclei Templates:

cat 200something.txt  | nuclei -t /home/kali/nuclei_temp/nuclei-templates/javascript/cves/ -t /home/kali/nuclei_temp/nuclei-templates/http/vulnerabilities/ / -t /home/kali/nuclei_temp/nuclei-templates/http/exposed-panels/ -t /home/kali/nuclei_temp/nuclei-templates/http/misconfiguration/

‚úÖ Use Burp Suite (Turbo Intruder or Repeater):

    Intercept requests, modify inputs

    Try testing for:

        IDOR (test user ID change)

        SSRF (e.g. url=http://evil.com)

        XSS (both reflected and DOM-based)

        SQLi (add ' OR 1=1 --)

        RCE via file upload or command injection

3. Parameter Discovery

If you're seeing only a few GET params, find hidden ones.

    Use ParamSpider or Arjun:

python3 arjun.py -u https://example.com -oT params.txt

Then test discovered parameters for common vulns using Burp or curl.
4. Auth and Session Checks

    Test for weak JWTs, cookie misconfigs, session fixation, etc.

    Try logging in, then resetting password ‚Äî does token/session stay valid?

    Check if you can use an old token after password change (like you found in HubSpot ‚Äî üî•)

5. Check for CORS Misconfig

curl -H "Origin: https://evil.com" -I https://target.com

Check if:

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

6. Shodan/Censys/JS Leak Hunting

    Look for dev servers using shodan or censys

    GitHub dorking for API keys

    Look at JS files on /admin, /dashboard, /config.js, etc.

7. Fuzzing

    Use ffuf or feroxbuster to brute-force hidden paths:

ffuf -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50

üö® High-Impact Vulns to Focus On

Here‚Äôs what often gets paid and discovered:
Vulnerability	Tools/Method
IDOR	Manual/Burp + changing IDs
Open Redirect	Manual test + payloads
SSRF	Burp, /image?url=, /webhook?target=
Subdomain takeover	subzy / takeover / dns recon
Sensitive JS	SecretFinder, manual analysis
DOM XSS	Chrome DevTools + XSStrike
Misconfigured Auth	Manual + Burp
üõ† Recommended Tool Additions

    dalfox ‚Äì for XSS detection

    gf + custom patterns ‚Äì for filtering important URLs

    tplmap ‚Äì for SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection)

    kiterunner ‚Äì API endpoint bruteforcer (used on Swagger/OpenAPI)

    wpscan or joomscan ‚Äì CMS-targeted scanning

üß† Optional: Sort URLs by Type

Group URLs from wayback/katana based on these patterns:

grep -E '(\?|&)(id|uid|user|name|email)=' urls.txt     # Good for IDOR
grep -E '(\?|&)(url|redirect|next)=' urls.txt          # Open Redirect
grep -E '(\?|&)(path|file|page)=' urls.txt             # LFI
grep -E '(\?|&)(q|search)=' urls.txt                   # XSS

If you want, paste your current recon folder tree and I‚Äôll help you sort and prioritize which targets to hit first.
